# SCT_DS_2
Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset. Handled missing values, transformed features, and visualized survival trends by gender, class, and age. Generated insights with plots and correlation heatmaps for better understanding of data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset
# Dataset
- Source: Titanic Dataset from Kaggle
- Description: Contains details about Titanic passengers including class, gender, age, ticket fare, cabin, embarkation port, and survival status
# Process Followed
- Data Cleaning
- Treated missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant fields
- Converted categorical data into appropriate formats
# Exploratory Data Analysis
- Studied the distribution of numerical and categorical variables
- Analyzed survival patterns based on passenger class, gender, and age
- Visualized correlations between important features
- Identified significant factors that influenced survival
# Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates than males
- First-class passengers had better chances of survival than those in second and third class
- Younger passengers, especially children, had higher survival rates compared to older passengers
- The port of embarkation showed variation in survival rates
# Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
# Conclusion
- The analysis highlights how exploratory data analysis can uncover important trends and relationships in data.
- In the Titanic dataset, gender, class, and age were the most significant factors that influenced survival chances.
